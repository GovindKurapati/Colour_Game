# About RGB:
The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

This game contains two modes:easy and hard. Based on the level of complexity the code generates colours and asks us to pick the correct colour which is displayed in RGB representation.
